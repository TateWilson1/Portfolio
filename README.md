## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio project! This repository contains the ongoing development of my personal portfolio website, which will eventually serve as my main online presence. Currently, this site is under construction, and I am continuously working on adding features, improving design, and showcasing my skills and projects.

## Project Goals

## Current Status

The website is currently in the development phase. Here are some of the features that are either planned or already in progress:

- Project listings with descriptions and images

## Future Plans

As I continue to develop this portfolio, I plan to integrate additional features, including:

- A blog section to share insights and experiences in the field of cybersecurity
